# Campaign Donation Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Required Includes
**Problem:** The `functions.php` and `config.php` files were not included, causing `generateUuid()` and `getDbConnection()` to be undefined.

**Fix:** Added proper includes at the top of the file:
```php
require_once __DIR__ .'/../includes/config.php';
require_once __DIR__ .'/../includes/functions.php';
```

### 2. Database Schema Mismatch
**Problem:** The donation code was trying to insert into a `transactions` table with columns that didn't exist (`type_id`, `reference_type`).

**Fix:** Updated the transaction insertion to use the correct schema:
```php
INSERT INTO transactions 
(id, wallet_id, type, amount, currency, status, reference_id, provider, created_at)
VALUES (?, ?, 'donation', ?, 'HTG', 'completed', ?, 'campaign_system', NOW())
```

### 3. Missing Campaign Validation
**Problem:** The donation processing could run even if the campaign wasn't loaded properly.

**Fix:** Added campaign validation before processing donations:
```php
if (!$campaign) {
    setFlashMessage('error', 'Cannot process donation: Campaign not found.');
    redirect('?page=crowdfunding');
    exit;
}
```

### 4. Insufficient Wallet Validation
**Problem:** Basic wallet check wasn't comprehensive enough.

**Fix:** Enhanced wallet validation with proper user verification:
```php
$walletStmt = $db->prepare("
    SELECT w.id, w.balance_htg 
    FROM wallets w
    INNER JOIN users u ON w.user_id = u.id
    WHERE u.id = ?
");
```

### 5. Campaign Status Validation
**Problem:** No checks for campaign status or end date.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive campaign validation:
```php
if ($campaign['status'] !== 'active') {
    setFlashMessage('error', 'This campaign is no longer accepting donations.');
    exit;
}

if (!empty($campaign['end_date'])) {
    $endDate = new DateTime($campaign['end_date']);
    $now = new DateTime();
    if ($endDate <= $now) {
        setFlashMessage('error', 'This campaign has ended.');
        exit;
    }
}
```

### 6. Enhanced Error Handling
**Problem:** Generic error messages made debugging difficult.

**Fix:** Added detailed error logging and development-mode error messages:
```php
error_log('Donation error for campaign ' . $campaignId . ', user ' . $userId . ': ' . $e->getMessage());

if (defined('DEV_MODE') && DEV_MODE === true) {
    setFlashMessage('error', 'Donation failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
}
```

## Donation Process Flow (Fixed)

1. **Form Submission:** User clicks "Donate Now" button
2. **Authentication Check:** Verify user is logged in
3. **Campaign Validation:** Ensure campaign exists and is active
4. **Input Validation:** Validate donation amount
5. **Wallet Validation:** Check user has sufficient funds
6. **Campaign Status Check:** Verify campaign is still accepting donations
7. **Database Transaction:** Create donation, update wallet, log transaction
8. **Activity Logging:** Record the donation activity
9. **Success Response:** Show confirmation message and redirect

## Files Modified

1. **views/campaign.php** - Main campaign page with donation functionality
   - Added required includes
   - Fixed database queries
   - Enhanced validation and error handling
   - Improved transaction logic

2. **tools/test-campaign-donation.php** - Testing script for validation
3. **tools/debug-donation.php** - Debug tool for testing donations

## Database Requirements Verified

- ✅ `campaigns` table exists
- ✅ `donations` table exists
- ✅ `wallets` table exists
- ✅ `transactions` table exists
- ✅ `activities` table exists
- ✅ Active campaigns available
- ✅ Users with wallet balance exist
- ✅ `generateUuid()` function working

## Next Steps

1. Test the donation functionality on a campaign page
2. Verify that the donation appears in the user's transaction history
3. Check that the campaign's raised amount is updated
4. Ensure proper error messages are displayed for various scenarios

The "Donate Now" button should now work properly with comprehensive validation and error handling.
